Problem 11:
Why doesn't it output the right answer?

Problem 15:
I'm thinking of implementing a recursive backtracking algorithm to solve
problem 15 using a grid data structure that has 0's and 1's (0 - not
visited, 1 - visited). I could solve this problem via combinatorics, or I
could use a recursive backtracking algorithm. Btw, the answer that
Sparrowhawks gave 20 choose 20 or whatever is wrong DuckerZ Also, instead
of recursive backtracking, just "simple recursion" as explained by bpaf.

Problem 23:
Whyy code take so long BibleThump - it's cuz you used lists and not sets
